## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisites

All students will be expected to have successfully completed:

- [*14.30 Introduction to Statistical Methods in Economics*](/courses/14-30-introduction-to-statistical-methods-in-economics-spring-2009)
- [*14.32 Econometrics*](/courses/14-32-econometrics-spring-2007)
- [*14.01 Principles of Microeconomics*](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/14-01-principles-of-microeconomics-fall-2018/)
- [*14.02 Principles of Macroeconomics*](/courses/14-02-principles-of-macroeconomics-spring-2014)

Students may find it useful to take at least one economics field course and perform a UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity) before taking this course, but these are not requirements.

## 14.33 Policies

- You are permitted, in fact encouraged, to discuss all course material with other students in the class. However, you must, obviously, hand in your own individual papers. Discussion with others is intended to clarify ideas, concepts, and technical questions, not to derive group papers.
- In fairness to students who complete assignments on time, students failing to hand in the proposal or assigned section drafts on time will receive no credit for that assignment. We will accept late papers, but their grades will be penalized a half a letter grade a day for lateness.
- Cheating or academic dishonesty in any form will not be tolerated and will result in swift punitive action. This includes but is not restricted to copying material from other students, lying, or plagiarizing from any source. See the Writing and Humanistic Studies' website section about [Avoiding Plagiarism](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/avoiding-plagiarism/), for clarification on what constitutes plagiarism. Any student found to have cheated or behaved unethically or dishonestly will be given a grade of F on the assignment involved and referred to the appropriate disciplinary committees within MIT for further action.
